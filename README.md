# Chattanooga City Code

## Disclaimer

This is work is incomplete and is based on the PDF versions of the code found at [http://www.chattanooga.gov/city-council/city-code](http://www.chattanooga.gov/city-council/city-code). This is not an official copy of the Chattanooga City Code and should not be relied upon for legal or other official purposes.

## Why represent code on Github

Law represents the source code of government. Rather than running on a computer, it runs in the offices of government and in the courts.

Like computer source code, law is amended and changed from time to time. These changes come from the legislative process. The same version control and change tracking tools which have been created for government can be used to track changes in law over time.

## Format

Initially, code is being represented in markdown format with one text file per chapter. Github has limitations to the size of files it can effectively display, so this representation may change in the future.
